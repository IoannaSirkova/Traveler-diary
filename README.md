# Traveler-diary
The trip is more enjoyable if shared with friends. To implement a program that yes
allows amateur travelers to share photos, experiences and
impressions.
Let there be two possible options when opening the application:
• registration of a new user - enter username, password and email
address. An entry is created in the user database. A new personal base is being created
user data.
• entry in an existing profile - after correctly entered name and
password opens the personal database of the respective user.
The user database contains information about available users in
system - username, password and email.The personal database of each user
corresponds to the username (user ani123 → file ani123.db) and contains
information about his travels - destination, period, rating (from 1 to 5), comment and
many photos (saved as file names).
Users of the application will want to check the reviews for a destination.
Let them be able to search for information on the entered destination to get information about
each of the users visited the destination: period, rating, comment, and list of
photos, as well as an average rating from all users who visited the destination. If given
user has visited a destination several times, the information for each visit
to be displayed separately.
